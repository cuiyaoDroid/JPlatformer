# About JPlatformer

JPlatformer is a classic platform game based on traditional jump 'n' run gameplay mechanics. The game is all about collecting score, avoiding deadly creatures and reaching the finish line. Also included is a built-in world editor that enables you to create, test and play your own worlds. At the moment, the project contains two language packages, English and German. JPlatformer is built on [libGDX](https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/), it is portable and runs cross-platform thanks to Java.

# Going Open Source

I have developed JPlatformer as a spare time project a few months ago and had a great time putting together all kinds of work for it, like writing code, drawing sprites and recording audio samples. As the project came to an end I published it as freeware on various platforms. Initially, I didn't even think about going open source. But after some very positive feedback and source code requests I decided to release JPlatformer as open source software.

The repository you find here is all you need to download, run and modify the game. Please feel free to contribute and extend the project. There is still plenty of room for improvements and new ideas.

# Download and Requirements

You can download the latest release [right here](http://www.stefanhoesemann.com/projects_jplatformer.html).

The game is quick and easy to setup as it's portable and doesn't need to be installed. Just unzip the downloaded file to whereever you want and launch "JPlatformer.jar". Windows users may also run "JPlatformer.exe". JPlatformer requires Java 8 or higher and runs on all supported platforms.

# How to Build

It is quite easy to build JPlatformer, especially if you are using Eclipse. You can simply import JPlatformer as a Git project. All dependencies (libGDX, that is) are configured in the pom.xml file and managed automatically by Maven. Once Maven has downloaded the required files all you need to do is run the DesktopLauncher class.

# Screenshots

These are some screenshots from the game showing the main menu, some gameplay and the world editor.
